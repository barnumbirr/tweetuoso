{"name":"Tweetuoso","tagline":"The Twitter Commandline client written in Python","body":"=============================\r\n![screenshot](https://raw.github.com/c0ding/tweetuoso/master/tweetuoso/doc/tweetuoso.banner.png)\r\n=============================\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nTweetuoso is a very light Twitter Command-line client developed in Python. The main goal of Tweetuoso is to become a fully-fledged twitter client with the same functions as the online version.\r\n\r\nFor now, it allows you to:\r\n\r\n* check your timeline\r\n* post tweets\r\n* show tweets that mentionned you\r\n* get your profile details\r\n* follow or unfollow people\r\n* search for 'query'\r\n\r\nMore is still to come...\r\n\r\n## Console screenshot (80x24):\r\n\r\n![screenshot](https://raw.github.com/c0ding/tweetuoso/master/tweetuoso/doc/screenshot.png)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nPre-requisites:\r\n\r\n* Python 2.6+ (not tested with Python 3+)\r\n* tweepy (for a Twitter API connection, obviously)\r\n* python-setuptools \r\n* Working API keys from Twitter\r\n\r\n\r\n### From source\r\n\r\nGet the latest version (from GitHub):\r\n \r\n    $ wget -O /tmp/tweetuoso-last.tgz https://github.com/c0ding/tweetuoso/tarball/master\r\n    $ sudo apt-get update\r\n    $ sudo apt-get install python-setuptools python-tweepy\r\n    $ cd /tmp\r\n\t$ tar zxvf tweetuoso-last.tgz\r\n\t$ cd c0ding-tweetuoso-*/tweetuoso\r\n\t$ chmod 777 core.py\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\n### Step 1: Register a new client app with Twitter\r\n\r\nNavigate to https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new. You might have to log in to the Twitter Developers site first, if you’re not already.\r\nFill in the registration fields as follows:\r\n\r\n![screenshot](https://raw.github.com/c0ding/tweetuoso/master/tweetuoso/doc/registration.png)\r\n\r\n### Step 2: OAuth settings\r\n\r\nNext, the app needs to be authorized to connect to your account so it can send tweets under your name. Paste the Consumer Key and Consumer Secret into tweetuoso.py. Then save and run the client on your system.\r\n\r\n![screenshot](https://raw.github.com/c0ding/tweetuoso/master/tweetuoso/doc/keys.png)\r\n\r\nYou should see a prompt like this:\r\n\r\n    $ Please visit this url to get the token: <url>\r\n    $ PIN:\r\n\r\nOpen that URL in your browser. You should see the standard OAuth Twitter connection screen:\r\n\r\nClick Allow.\r\n\r\nTwitter will then provide you with a PIN code that authenticates the connection between the client app and your Twitter account.\r\n\r\nEnter this PIN into the Tweetuoso:\r\n\r\n    $ PIN: 2781961\r\n\r\nThe script will then print out another key/secret pair: (The values will be different each time!)\r\n\r\n    $ ACCESS_KEY = '124242RCyi3g0cZ4r5BWL047rsh0S0yv5VxAGwTKCOsHAb'\r\n    $ ACCESS_SECRET = 'kaTXiC489qo8y6haTBSlwOqR1syG83tzPG2StdQ'\r\n\r\nKeep this information on your screen because we’ll need it in the next step.\r\n\r\n### Step 3: Paste the keys into Tweetuoso:\r\n\r\nPaste the Access Token and Access Secret from the end of step 2 into this script, filling the access_token and access_secret constants.\r\n\r\nFinally, we’re all set up. Our command line app is registered as a Twitter client and the app is connected to our Twitter user account\r\n\r\n## Running\r\n\r\nSimply execute tweetuoso.py and enjoy!\r\n\r\nPersonally I like to add Tweetuoso to my PATH=${PATH}: so that I can execute it whenever I want without needing to navigate to the right directory.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n```\r\n           DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE\r\n                   Version 2, December 2004\r\n \r\nCopyright (C) 2004 c0ding <https://twitter.com/c0ding>\r\n \r\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim or modified\r\ncopies of this license document, and changing it is allowed as long\r\nas the name is changed.\r\n \r\n           DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE\r\n  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n \r\n 0.
