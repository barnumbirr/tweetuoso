=============================

## Description

Tweetuoso is a very light Twitter Command-line client developed in Python. The main goal of Tweetuoso is to become a fully-fledged twitter client with the same functions as the online version.

For now, it allows you to:

* check your timeline
* post tweets
* show tweets that mentionned you
* get your profile details
* follow or unfollow people
* search for 'query'

More is still to come. So feel free to report issues or to contribute.
