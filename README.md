## Description


**Tweetuoso** is a very light Twitter Command-line client developed in Python. The main goal of Tweetuoso is to become a fully-fledged twitter client with the same functions as the online version.

For now, it allows you to:

* check your timeline
* post tweets
* show tweets that mentionned you
* get your profile details
* follow or unfollow people
* search for 'query'
* stalk people (or yourself)
* show current trends

More is still to come...

## Installation


Pre-requisites:

* Python 2.6+ (not tested with Python 3+)
* tweepy >= 1.40 (for a Twitter API connection, obviously)
* requests 1.1.0
* colorama 0.2.5
* python-setuptools 
* Working API keys from Twitter


### From source

**Remember to configure Tweetuoso before install it!**

Get the latest version (from GitHub):

    $ wget -O /tmp/tweetuoso-last.tgz https://github.com/c0ding/tweetuoso/tarball/master
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install python-setuptools python-tweepy python-requests
    $ cd /tmp
    $ tar zxvf tweetuoso-last.tgz
    $ chmod -R 777 c0ding-tweetuoso-*    
    $ cd c0ding-tweetuoso-*/
    $ python setup.py install


### From PyPi


Coming soon...


## Configuration


### Step 1: Register a new client app with Twitter


Navigate to https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new. You might have to log into the Twitter Developers site first, if you’re not already.
Fill in the registration fields as follows:

**Note**: whatever you specify for Application Name will be the “via” name your followers see in the details of tweets issued from your command line app.


### Step 2: OAuth settings


Next, the app needs to be authorized to connect to your account so it can send tweets under your name. Paste the **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret** into tweetuoso.py. Then save and run **Tweetuoso** on your system.

You should see a prompt like this:

    $ Please visit this url to get the token: <url>
    $ PIN:

Open that URL in your browser. You should see the standard OAuth Twitter connection screen. Click **Allow**.

Twitter will then provide you with a PIN code that authenticates the connection between the client app and your Twitter account.

Enter this PIN into the Tweetuoso prompt:

    $ PIN: 2781961

Tweetuoso will then print out another key/secret pair: (The values will be different each time!)

    $ ACCESS_KEY = '124242RCyi3g0cZ4r5BWL047rsh0S0yv5VxAGwTKCOsHAb'
    $ ACCESS_SECRET = 'kaTXiC489qo8y6haTBSlwOqR1syG83tzPG2StdQ'

Keep this information on your screen because we’ll need it in the next step.

### Step 3: Paste the keys into Tweetuoso


Paste the **Access Token** and **Access Secret** from the end of step 2 into the tweetuoso.py file, filling the **access_token** and **access_secret** constants.

### Step 4: Application Type


On the Twitter Developer website, navigate to the **Settings** tab. Allow your application Read, Write and direct messages access.

Finally, we’re all set up. Our command line app is registered as a Twitter client and the app is connected to our Twitter user account.

## Running


Simply follow th steps above and execute tweetuoso.py. Enjoy!
